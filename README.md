# DailyTennis

This app is one of my biggest passion projects right up next to my website. 

Daily Tennis was a show my friends and I hosted on my Snapchat when I was in high school, you can read more about it [here](https://johnmdoll.com/#:~:text=have%20asked%20for%3F-,Daily%20Tennis,-If%20you%20ask).

This idea originally came to my head in the summer of 2020 when summer was in a lull because of covid. I had just completed my freshman year and really wanted to apply myself and what I had learned. I dove deep into Swift programming and the Apple Developer Program and learned that there was so much more to making an app than it seemed. Work on the app stalled until the summer of 2022, just after I completed my junior year. It became my summer project and goal to complete it. Currently, I am hung up by App Store Review Guidelines which I am working hard to satisfy and overcome.

All of the technology and programming I had to learn to make this project possible was completely self taught. At the time of writing, I've never taken a mobile applications course or anything of the sort.
